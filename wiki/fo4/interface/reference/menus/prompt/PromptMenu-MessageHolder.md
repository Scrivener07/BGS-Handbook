# MessageHolder.as Documentation

This documentation details the `MessageHolder` ActionScript file, which is part of an application that utilizes the Adobe Flash technology. This class is designed to hold messages, likely within a user interface component for a game or application. Below is an overview of the class and its constructor method.

## Class Overview

The `MessageHolder` class is a dynamic class that extends the `BSUIComponent` from the Shared.AS3 package. This inheritance implies that `MessageHolder` is likely a user interface component with additional functionalities provided by the `BSUIComponent` class.

### Constructor

The `MessageHolder` class has a single constructor method that calls the constructor of its superclass. This initializes the `MessageHolder` instance.

## Class Definition

Below is the ActionScript code for `MessageHolder` contained in `MessageHolder.as`:

```actionscript
package {
    import Shared.AS3.BSUIComponent;

    public dynamic class MessageHolder extends BSUIComponent {
        public function MessageHolder() {
            super();
        }
    }
}
```

## Constructor Details

| Constructor     | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `MessageHolder` | When an instance of `MessageHolder` is created, it calls the `super()` method to ensure that any initialization processes defined in the `BSUIComponent` superclass are executed. |

## Usage Example

To use the `MessageHolder` class, you would typically create an instance of it within your application. Here is a simple example:

```actionscript
var messageHolderInstance:MessageHolder = new MessageHolder();
addChild(messageHolderInstance); // This assumes you're within a DisplayObjectContainer context.
```

## üìù Notes

- **Dynamic Class**: The class is defined as dynamic, which means you can add additional properties to instances of this class at runtime.
- **Inheritance**: `MessageHolder` inherits from `BSUIComponent`, which suggests that it should be used within a user interface context, and it likely has visual properties and methods.
- **Use Case**: While the specific details of what messages this component holds are not evident from the provided code, it likely serves as a container for text or interactive messages within a user interface.

## üîó References

- To fully utilize the `MessageHolder` class, understanding the `BSUIComponent` class and its capabilities is essential, as `MessageHolder` extends it and presumably uses its features.
- Further details about creating custom components in ActionScript and working with inheritance would help when working with `MessageHolder`, especially if one needs to extend or modify its functionality.

By documenting this class, we aim to provide an easily understandable resource for developers who need to interact with or modify the `MessageHolder` component within their projects.
