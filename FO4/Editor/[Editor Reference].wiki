== Welcome to the Creation Kit Editor Reference ==
This portion of the wiki exists as a living reference for the various tools, concepts and objects in the [[Creation Kit]].
Here you will find topics covering the various forms, dialogs, and options you will encounter while using the [[Creation Kit]].
If you're not sure how to use an [[Activator]], how to change the contents of a [[Container]], or what the [[Object Window]] is, then this category is a good place to look.
Unlike the [[:Category:Tutorials|Tutorial hub]], you may notice that this page doesn't contain a lot of links or direction.
That's because this section of the wiki is more of an encyclopedia - it exists as a reference for when you aren't sure how something works or need more information.

As with all of the Creation Kit Wiki, your contributions are valuable.
If you find a page that is missing or inaccurate, please update it if you have the knowledge, or flag it for moderators by making a note on the discussion page.
