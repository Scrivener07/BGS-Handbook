This tells the [[Creation Kit]] where to temporarily put script files that are being edited or compiled, as well as the compiler [[Papyrus Project]] files that it generates.
When this entry is set to the default empty string, then the editor will use a temporary folder in the user's Windows temporary folder at <Code>"C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp\PapyrusTemp"</Code>.

There is generally no need to change this setting unless the drive your user folder is on is severely low on disk space, or something else is preventing the [[Creation Kit]] from writing to the folder.
