== sAdditionalImports ==
* '''Default:''' <Code>"$(source);.\Data\Scripts\Source\Base"</Code>

This setting is a list of additional folders that the editor and compiler should use.
The folders are separated by semicolons, and will be used in left-to-right order.
Any listed import folders on the left will override import folders on the right.

A special variable called <Code>$(source)</Code> may be specifed to indicate the value of <Code>sScriptSourceFolder</Code> should be used.
The order of imports may be verifed by looking at the import list within the script tab of the [[Preference Window]].
Like the source folder, paths may be absolute or relative to the editor's isntallation directory.

'''Examples'''
<source lang="ini">
; Include a "base" folder containing all original game scripts, let DLC1 override it, and then finally override both with the source folder:
sAdditionalImports="$(Source);Data/Scripts/Source/DLC01;Data/Scripts/Source/Base"
</Source>
<BR>
<source lang="ini">
; Include all DLC imports.
sAdditionalImports="$(Source);.\Data\Script\Source\DLC06;.\Data\Script\Source\DLC05;.\Data\Script\Source\DLC04;.\Data\Script\Source\DLC03;.\Data\Script\Source\DLC02;.\Data\Script\Source\DLC01;.\Data\Script\Source\Base"
</Source>
</onlyinclude>
