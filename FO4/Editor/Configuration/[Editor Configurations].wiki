= Editor Settings =
The following settings are editor-only [[Initialization File]] settings.

== Defaults ==
The following block shows the defaults for all the various settings.
If you end up messing something up you can always copy this block back into your ini file (or delete the block entirely):

 [Papyrus]
 sScriptSourceFolder="../Source/Scripts/"
 sAdditionalImports=""
 sScriptTempFolder=""
 sScriptCompiledFolder="Data/Scripts/"
 sCompilerFolder="Papyrus Compiler/"

== Individual Settings ==
You will typically not need to touch any of these settings, though adjusting the source folder and imports settings can help you keep individual groups of scripts separate.

{{Editor:Configuration:sScriptSourceFolder}}
{{Editor:Configuration:sAdditionalImports}}
{{Editor:Configuration:sScriptTempFolder}}
{{Editor:Configuration:sScriptCompiledFolder}}
{{Editor:Configuration:sCompilerFolder}}
{{Editor:Configuration:sAutoFillNamespaceDefault}}
