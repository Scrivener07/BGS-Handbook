* '''Default:''' <Code>1.2</Code>

This setting controls how much time the main Papyrus update loop gets.
This loop mainly controls function dispatch.
If a lot of function calls are being made and a lot of scripts are running, increasing this value may improve script performance at the cost of reduced game framerate.
However most of the time the VM won't take this entire time slice and increasing the value will have no effect.
