=== Working with Records ===
When you are using the [[Creation Kit]], the records that you have edited in the currently active [[Data File]] will be marked with a '''*''' within the [[Object Window]].
To see all records a [[Data File]] changes or adds in a single list, do the following.
#Make sure the [[Data File]] is saved to disk.
#Then navigate to '''File -> Data...''' from the [[Creation Kit]] title bar menu.
#Highlight your [[Data File]] in the left pane, and  press the '''Details...''' button.
#A separate window will then show the full list of records that the [[Data File]] adds or changes.
#Select any file and choose the '''Details...''' button.

The above method is the only way to get a full listing within the [[Creation Kit]] of your changes to a master files records, and additional records your plugin creates.
It's worth noting that your additional records will have FormID's that are higher than those of the master files.
The first 2 characters count up for each file loaded.
So sorting by FormID, by clicking the column heading, becomes a useful tool too.

==== Ignoring Records ====
[[File:Data File Details Mark As Ignored Window.png]]{{ClearFloats}}

If you see some records listed that you didn't intend to change, you can highlight them in the popup box and press the {{key press|Delete}} key.
This will mark them with an '''I''' for ''ignored''.
The ignored records will be purged from your file the next time you save it.

This window is very tall and so requires some ''Microsoft Windows'' shortcuts to navigate.
With the ''More Info'' window focused, press the {{key press|Alt|Spacebar}} keys together to open the ''System Menu''.
Select the ''Move'' option and press the {{key press|Up}} & {{key press|Down}} arrow keys to navigate.
