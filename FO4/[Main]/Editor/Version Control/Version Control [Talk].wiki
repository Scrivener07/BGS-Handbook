=== Create Master File ===
The Creation Kit version control system will need a master [[Data File]] to merge child plugins into.
There are various ways to create new master files with community made software.
Some of these include [[XEdit]], [[Wrye Bash]], or any hexidecial editor.
There are even more software projects that can be found with an internet search.

Create a new master plugin.
