The Creation Kit is the official tooling by Bethesda Game Studios for working with [[Data File]]s.
This editor was the same tool used by Bethesda Game Studios to create Fallout 4 and its DLC.

Due to the Creation Engine's modular nature, mod authors may take advantage to create their own content.
Such content as new [[Quest]]s, [[Actor]]s, [[Weapon]]s, [[Armor]]s, and everything else a [[Data File]] contains.
The Creation Kit is free to anyone with a PC copy of Fallout 4 and a [https://bethesda.net Bethesda.net] account.

== Installing ==
The Creation Kit is acquired through the ''Bethesda.net Launcher''.

== Setup ==
For the most part, the Creation Kit is ready to use after installation.
Though depending on the type of mod project, some settings and configurations may need to be changed.
For the smoothest experience, consider some configurations such as [[Enable Loose Files]] and [[Enable Debug Logging]].
[[Sharing Mods]] on Xbox and Playstation will require [[Bethesda Login Window|signing into your Bethesda.net account]] with the Creation Kit.
