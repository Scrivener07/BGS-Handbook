A loose file is a file that exist within the Fallout 4 directory that is not listed by any manifests.
By default, Fallout 4 will ignore loose files.
This includes the compiled .pex files the [[Papyrus Compiler]] creates.
If you find that none of your scripts appear to be working in the game, then most likely it is because you have not enabled loose files.

# Open\Create the file :  <Documents>\My Games\Fallout 4\Fallout4Custom.ini
# Populate the Fallout4Custom.ini file with the following:
<source lang="ini">
