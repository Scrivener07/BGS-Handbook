<onlyinclude>
== bLoadDebugInformation ==
* '''Default:''' <Code>0</Code>

This setting enables or disables the loading of additional debug information which is essentially line number information.
If this setting is off, error messages cannot generate line number data.
Turning this on will allow line numbers to be available in error traces at the cost of increased memory usage.

This is used by the game to report [[Papyrus Runtime Errors#Stack Traces|Papyrus Runtime Errors via Stack Traces]].
