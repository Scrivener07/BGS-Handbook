== sDefaultLogOverlay ==
* '''Default:''' <Code>Papyrus</Code>

This setting tells the game which log to show by default in the Papyrus log overlays.
By default this is the global "Papyrus" log, but the name of any user log will also work.

'''Examples'''
<source lang="ini">
; Tells the game to default to the workshop user log.
sDefaultLogOverlay=Workshop
</Source>
