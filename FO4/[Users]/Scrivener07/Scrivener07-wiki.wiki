* Help Kingtobbe format his external link resource. https://pastebin.com/QatiZ4ec
* The Creation Kit's form picker (used by script properties as well as the Constructible Item screen), has a limit of 99 characters. If a record exists that could populate that menu that has 100+ characters, the CK crashes on trying to display that menu. This is an editor ID limitation. If you make a form called <code>Some_NewObject_WithARidiculouslyLongEditorID_ThatForSomeReasonSurpasses99Characters_AndCrashesTheConstructibleItemScreen</code>, accessing screens that could include that form in a drop-down will crash the CK.
* Glean more notes for [[FormList]]. https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/beb2sa/papyrus_formlists_are_annoyingly_inconsistent/

* [[Help: Wiki Editing Style Guide]] & [[Help: Wiki Editing Syntax Guide]]
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Contents/Editing_Wikipedia Editing Wikipedia]



== [[Tutorials]] ==
* [[Bethesda Tutorial Conversations]]
=== [[:Category:Scripting Guides]] ===

*Possibly add [[Glossary]] for terms like ''Base Object''. See also Skyrim wiki @ https://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Glossary
*Restore the [[Condition Function]]s reference.
*Add proper redirect pages for established categories. Also continue to restore or consolidate the broken redirects like [[Default Objects]] and [[Regions]].



=== [[Editor Interface]] ===
*Expand the [[Editor Interface]] and related "windows".
*Document the [[Creation Kit]] [[Menu Bar]].
*Add '''Object Window Layout''' to [[Object Window]], this is the layout editor window "for" this window. [[Quest]] and other windows have these layout editors too.
=== Windows ===

=== [[Tooling Reference]] ===
==== [[Creation Kit Toolset]] ====



=== [[Game File Reference]] ===
*Add page anchors to file extensions in the [[Game File Reference]]. Add redirects to the anchors for extension in all caps. (TXT, FLA, PEX)
*Mention the [[Archive File]] naming scheme when paired with a [[Data File]]. For example, <code>MyArchive - Main.ba2</code> and <code>MyArchive - Textures.ba2</code>
*Add [[Text File]], tab-delimited format for some [[Creation Kit]] report exporting.
*Creation INI reference. Maybe add as a section to [[Creation Kit]] and a new page called [[Fallout 4]].
==== [[Data File]] ====
*Expand on [[Version Control and Multiple Contributor Collaboration ]] for the [[Creation Kit]].

=== [[Object Class Reference]] ===
*Research type signatures for Forms. Add cheat sheet for signatures and type icons.
*Restore the enormous editors like [[Quest]], [[Actor]], and [[Race]].
*Better pages for [[Object]], [[Base Object]], [[Object Reference]], and [[Reference]].
*Add template for where objects can be found in the [[Object Window]]. For example: <code>The [[Key]] [[Object]] is found within the [[Object Window]] under the [[Items Category]].</code>
==== Icons ====
I had the idea to add the editor icons to object pages alongside the object's type code.
*[[File:Actor Action EditorIcon.png]] [[Actor Action]]
*[[File:Perk EditorIcon.png]] [[Perk]]
*[[File:Quest EditorIcon.png]] [[Quest]]

=== [[Console Command Reference]] ===
=== [[Condition Function Reference]] ===

== [[Scripting]] ==
*Expand papyrus pages to include both minimalistic and complete source code examples.
*Add better pages on structs & more actual examples of when structs are most useful.
*Finish [[F4SE]] script documentation up to the current version.
*Document the papyrus assembly. The [[Script File]] may be the only mention of papyrus assembly. The user cadpnq has started to document some of the assembly instructions here https://github.com/cadpnq/papyrith/wiki/Instruction-Reference
=== Papyrus Concepts ===
=== Other Resources ===
=== External Text Editors ===
=== Reference Pages ===
==== [[Papyrus Language Reference]] ====
==== Papyrus Script Objects ====

= F4SE =
*Remove F4SE pages from the [[Papyrus]] category.
*Add templates for F4SE features. (auto add to category, icon, required version, etc..)
*[[F4SE:DummyTestPage]] Maybe prefix like this?

This is something I have delayed doing for some time now.
With the wiki tools I have access to, this would be a very tedious and time consuming task.
I have continued to add new f4se pages to the [[Papyrus]] category for consistency.
I would rather reorganize/move the f4se pages all at once than a mix.
See [[F4SE]] talk page.

Using [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Subpages Subpages] might be an option if that is enabled in the wiki software.
Subpages are enabled for user & talk pages by default, but not the main namespace.
