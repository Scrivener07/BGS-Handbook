== iMaxAllocatedMemoryBytes ==
* '''Default:''' <Code>153600</Code> (150kb)

This is the maximum amount of memory the VM will allocate in total for stack frames.
If an allocation would push memory usage over this limit, the VM will instead wait for more memory to be freed.
Increasing this value may improve performance in high-stress situations with lots of scripts running, but will use more memory.
Note that it is possible to exceed this value temporarily while loading a save game due to slightly different allocation ordering.
