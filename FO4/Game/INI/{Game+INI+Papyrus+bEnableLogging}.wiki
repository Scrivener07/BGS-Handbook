<onlyinclude>
== bEnableLogging ==
* '''Default:''' <Code>0</Code>

This setting turns logging on and off.
If off, no logging will occur, even traces, and so it will override the <Code>bEnableTrace</Code> value.
The in-game log display will still work, but nothing will be written to disk.
Turning this off may improve performance due to less disk activity.
