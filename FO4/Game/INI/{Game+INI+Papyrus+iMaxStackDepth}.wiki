== iMaxStackDepth ==
* '''Default:''' <Code>100</Code>

This is the maximum stack depth the VM will allow before forcibly killing function calls on that stack.
This mainly helps with killing any potential infinite recursion.
If you find yourself hitting this, consider using loops over recursion.
Increasing this value may increase stack memory pressure, while decreasing this may forcibly kill valid scripts.
