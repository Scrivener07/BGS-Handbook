<onlyinclude>
== bEnableTrace ==
* '''Default:''' <Code>0</Code>

This setting turns on and off the script trace commands.
System error and warning messages will still be logged to disk.
If <Code>bEnableLogging</Code> is false, this setting is ignored as nothing will be written to disk anyway.
Trace commands will NOT be visible in the in-game log display if this setting is off.
Turning this off may improve performance due to less disk activity.
