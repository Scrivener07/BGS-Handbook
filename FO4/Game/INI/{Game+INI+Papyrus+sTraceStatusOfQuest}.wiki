== sTraceStatusOfQuest ==
* '''Default:''' <Code>Empty</Code>

This setting sets a [[Quest]] to track for script changes by form ID.
The quest that this setting specifies will spit out a Papyrus stack trace to the log every time a Papyrus script tries to change something with it.
For example, starting, stopping, setting a stage, or showing an objective.

This setting accepts a form ID (as visible in the editor, optionally prefixed with a ''0x''), an editor ID, or a plugin (with extension) followed by a comma and a form ID.
Because of the way string ini settings work, do not have any comments on the same line as they will be treated as part of the value.

'''Examples'''
<source lang="ini">
; Tracks the quest with a form ID of 000105FA
sTraceStatusOfQuest = 000105FA

; Tracks the quest with an editor ID of MQ101
sTraceStatusOfQuest = MQ101

; Tracks the quest with a form ID of 0100FB14 (ignoring the load index of 01) in the "CoolDLC" plugin.
sTraceStatusOfQuest = CoolDLC.esm, 0100FB14
