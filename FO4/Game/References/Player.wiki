The [[Player]] is a special [[Actor]] reference which is controlled by the [[User]].
The [[Player]] is almost always loaded by the Fallout 4 and uses a named reference called <code>PlayerREF</code>.
The [[Player]]s base [[Actor]] form is called <code>Player</code>.

The developers used a design paradigm dubbed "[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(mythology) Atlas]" to optimize how and when Fallout 4 loads data.
With interior and exterior [[WorldSpace]]s, only the [[Cell]]s immediatly surrounding the [[Player]] will be loaded by Fallout 4.
How and when [[WorldSpace]]s are loaded all rests on the [[Player]]s shoulders.


== Notes ==
* The [[Initialization File]] setting called <code>uGridsToLoad</code> will influence how many [[Cell]]s are loaded surrounding the [[Player]]. It is not recommended to alter this setting.
