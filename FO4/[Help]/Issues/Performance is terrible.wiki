== Site performance is in the trash.==
Maybe I would leave more commit messages if the site didnt fail to load and trash submissions constantly.
The last big change I spent 30 minutes straight, copy and pasting the same submission over and over again.
When it finally submitted, I had forgot to copy my commit message too.
My commit message would have been "split into sections, added links, added details, and changed format".
Bethesda, if your web team reads this then PLEASE consider fixing the site.
It has behaved this way for years now and is the reason contributions are rare. [[User:Scrivener07|Scrivener07]] ([[User talk:Scrivener07|talk]]) 2019-09-02T17:28:03 (EDT)
