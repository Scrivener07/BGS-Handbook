This guide demonstrates how to add simple Markdown rendering support for the body text of `Message` forms in the Creation Kit.
Visit <https://www.markdownguide.org/> to learn about the Markdown language.
The Markdown implementation for this project will be simplistic and built specifically for Fallout 4.

The following Markdown will be implemented.

- Headings: `# H1`, `## H2`, `### H3`
- Paragraphs: To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.
- Bold: `This is **bold** text.`
- Italics: `This is **italicized** text.`
- Bold and Italic: `This is ***italicized and embolden*** text.`
- Block Quotes: `> This is quoted text.`
- Lists: Support both ordered and unordered lists.
- Code Block: Support code blocks with a triple back tick.
- Code Highlight: The `MyObject` has a code highlight.
- Images: Support loading SWF file by relative path.
