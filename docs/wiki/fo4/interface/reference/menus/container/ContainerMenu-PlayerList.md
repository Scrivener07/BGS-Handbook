## Class Definition

**File**: `PlayerList.as`

**Package**: The `PlayerList` class is defined within an unnamed package.

**Inheritance**: `PlayerList` is a subclass of `ItemList`.

```actionscript
package {
    public dynamic class PlayerList extends ItemList {
        // Class contents go here
    }
}
```

## Constructor

The `PlayerList` class contains a constructor that simply calls the constructor of its superclass, `ItemList`.

```actionscript
public function PlayerList() {
    super();
}
```

## Usage

To use the `PlayerList` class, create an instance of it by calling its constructor. Since it is a dynamic class, properties and methods can be added to it at runtime.

**Example**:

```actionscript
var playerList:PlayerList = new PlayerList();

// Since PlayerList is dynamic, you can add properties like this
playerList.teamName = "Warriors";
```

**Note**: As a best practice, avoid adding properties and methods at runtime as it can lead to hard-to-maintain code.

| **Property/Method** | **Type** | **Description**                 |
|---------------------|----------|---------------------------------|
| `PlayerList`        | Constructor | Initializes a new instance of the PlayerList class. |

**üöÄ Tip**: Always make sure to create well-documented code by adding comments and adhering to coding standards. This will increase readability and maintainability.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Caution**: Since `PlayerList` is a dynamic class, be mindful of the potential for runtime errors caused by typos or undefined properties/methods. Use this feature wisely.
