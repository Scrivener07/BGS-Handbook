The `PlayerListEntry` class is a dynamic class that extends the functionality of `ItemListEntry`.
It is designed to represent an entry in a player list, providing the foundational structure needed for player list items while allowing for additional properties and methods to be added dynamically.

## Code Structure

```actionscript
package {
    public dynamic class PlayerListEntry extends ItemListEntry {
        public function PlayerListEntry() {
            super();
        }
    }
}
```

## Class Definition

### **PlayerListEntry**

This dynamic class extends the `ItemListEntry` class. As it is dynamic, properties and methods can be added to instances of the class at runtime.

| Constructor          | Description                                           |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `PlayerListEntry()`  | Initializes a new instance of the **PlayerListEntry** class by calling the constructor of the superclass **ItemListEntry**. |

---

## Usage

To use the `PlayerListEntry` class, you can create an instance of it as part of a player list management system. This instance can then be customized on the fly due to its dynamic nature.

Here's an example of how to instantiate a `PlayerListEntry` object:

```actionscript
var playerEntry:PlayerListEntry = new PlayerListEntry();
```

As a dynamic class, you could then add properties to this instance like so:

```actionscript
playerEntry.name = "PlayerName";
playerEntry.score = 1000;
playerEntry.rank = 1;
```
