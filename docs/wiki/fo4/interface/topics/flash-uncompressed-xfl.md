## Uncompressed XFL
If these are intended to be version controlled, then use the XFL format instead of FLA.
Think of an FLA as an archive like zip or ba2.
Its full of internal directories of XML files.
You can save your project in this XFL format which is the uncompressed version of an FLA.

This uncompressed, XML-ified format is perfect for version control.
Even vector graphics are actually represented in text form.

Its all very git friendly this way.
