| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `param1`  | `String` | The type of the event, accessible as `KeyboardEvent.type`. |

**Example usage**:

```

---

## Inheritance

The `KeyboardEventEx` class extends **`flash.events.KeyboardEvent`**.

---

## Notes üìù

- The class is marked as `final`, which means it cannot be subclassed.
- The additional `controllerIdx` property can be used to distinguish input from different controllers, which is particularly useful in multi-controller environments such as gaming consoles.

## Example Code

```actionscript
import scaleform.gfx.KeyboardEventEx;

function handleKeyboardEvent(event:KeyboardEventEx):void {
    trace("Key event type: " + event.type + " from controller index: " + event.controllerIdx);
}

var eventInstance:KeyboardEventEx = new KeyboardEventEx(KeyboardEvent.KEY_DOWN);
eventInstance.controllerIdx = 1;

handleKeyboardEvent(eventInstance);
```

**Output**:

```
Key event type: keyDown from controller index: 1
```
