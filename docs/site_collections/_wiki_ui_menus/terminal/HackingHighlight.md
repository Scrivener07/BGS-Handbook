The `HackingHighlight.as` file contains a class definition for `HackingHighlight`, which is an extension of the `MovieClip` class from the `flash.display` package.
This class is designed to work with Flash/ActionScript 3.0 and is meant to visually highlight an element, presumably for a hacking-themed interface, with both a border and text elements.

## Class: `HackingHighlight`

### Description

The `HackingHighlight` class serves as a dynamic class that extends `MovieClip`.
It is equipped with two primary components:

- A border, represented by `HackingHighlightBorder_mc`
- A text field, represented by `HackingHighlightText_tf`

These members are expected to be visually represented in the associated FLA file for the Flash project.

### Properties

| Property Name               | Type          | Description                              |
| --------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **`HackingHighlightBorder_mc`** | `MovieClip`   | A `MovieClip` instance that serves as the border for the highlight effect. |
| **`HackingHighlightText_tf`**   | `TextField`   | A `TextField` instance for displaying text within the highlight effect.  |

### Constructor

The `HackingHighlight` class has a single constructor that initializes a new instance of the class.

```actionscript
public dynamic class HackingHighlight extends MovieClip {
    public var HackingHighlightBorder_mc:MovieClip;
    public var HackingHighlightText_tf:TextField;

    public function HackingHighlight() {
        super();
    }
}
```

### Example Usage

To use the `HackingHighlight` class, you would typically create an instance of it within your Flash project.
The exact implementation details would depend on the larger context of your project.

```actionscript
var highlight:HackingHighlight = new HackingHighlight();
addChild(highlight);
highlight.HackingHighlightText_tf.text = "Target Acquired";
// Additional setup and styling can be done here
```

**ðŸ“„ Note**: It's assumed that the visual elements for `HackingHighlightBorder_mc` and `HackingHighlightText_tf` are set up in the associated `.fla` file and properly linked to the class.

### File Details

- **Filename**: `HackingHighlight.as`
- **Language**: ActionScript 3.0
- **Location**: Presumably within the `package` directory, relative to the root of your Flash project.

**ðŸ”’ Security Consideration**: Ensure that the usage of `MovieClip` and `TextField` does not expose your application to security risks by validating all input data and using secure coding practices.

### Dependencies

- `flash.display.MovieClip`
- `flash.text.TextField`
